24857,PhilFIDA - Sisal Development Project,2,0,"['1', '5', '8']","Sisal is wildly and sporadically growing in almost all of the provinces of Central Visayas, specifically in the provinces of Cebu and Siquijor.  In most cases, it is traditionally grown along hedges to demarcate farm boundaries, and to produce fiber ropes for farm use and/or to supplement incomes.  It can be observed that such fibercrop thrive well in the harsh conditions and mostly in the unproductive and marginal land in the said provinces, being a drought resistance perennial crops.  If properly introduce and adopted, sisal farming can be a good alternative livelihood for farmers whose farm cannot be utilized to cultivate food crops -  such as, corn, rootcrop, etc., that the most farmers in this provinces traditional produced.  Its production requires virtually no external inputs (i.e. fertilizer, insecticides, and/or pesticides) after planting and provides protection against soil erosion.  The leaves used for fiber production can be harvested continuously throughout the year for roughly 15-year period without replanting it and allows farmers to harvest whenever the need for additional income is at the highest.  As such, it can support sustainable agriculture initiative of the community by sustaining the economic viability of farm operation, enhancing the environmental quality, the natural resources base upon which the agricultural economy as well as the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole.  In addition, it can from part of the overall solution to climate change.   Thus, this project is being proposed and will be known as Sisal Development Project primarily aimed to provide alternative livelihood and sustain economic activities to our people in the countryside thru sisal farming and help augment their standard of living.  
        Components of this project shall include the Establishment of Sisal Nurseries in six (6) different locations to sustain the planting materials need of the beneficiaries.  Likewise, planting materials production and distribution to support the development of new sisal production areas and of course with institutional strengthening through Training and Education, that includes the conduct of Training of Trainers (TOTs) for LGU Technicians and farmer leaders as well as the LGU-led Livelihood Training to capacitate the identified LGUs, farmer’s association and farmer-beneficiaries.
        This project is a collaborative undertaking of partner agencies like PhilFIDA, Department of Agriculture, Local Government Units (Municipal and Provincial LGU) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), in order to maximize resources, work hand in hand geared towards one and common desire to give the best possible service to our clientele.

The main purpose of this project is to uplift the quality of life of our people in the countryside through increased productivity and real income by insuring stability of the fiber industry in the country.  It specifically aims to;
(1)  develop an aggregate of two hundred ten (210) hectares sisal areas in the provinces of Bohol (30-ha), Cebu (75-ha), Negros Oriental (30-ha), and Siquijor (75-ha.);
(2) establish six (6) hectares Sisal Nurseries as source of planting material needs of the beneficiaries for the development of new sisal production areas in the targeted provinces;

Results include: 

- The production output of abaca fibres was increased up from 10 kg of fiber/day to 120 kg/day following the provision of simple machines that make it easier for the smallholder farmers to extract the fibres from the leaf sheaths. This contributed to the increase in income of the farmers. 

- A total of 36 smallholder farmers have been Rainforest Alliance certified on 149 ha of agricultural land (500 ha originally planned). 

The present strategic alliance aims to harness the results and lessons learnt for the diversification and expansion of the Abaca Sustainability Initiative (ASI), i.e. knowledge and experience are to be disseminated to new regions and firmly established with a view to achieve a broad impact and promoting structure-building results. 

Under ASI+, the approach is to be extended. The proven concept of GIZ's Farmer Business School approach will be introduced to promote the entrepreneurial skills and business management capacity of the smallholder farmers and their organizations in order to identify opportunities for enhancing their business operations and incomes. In addition, applied abaca research will be resumed, and the task of promoting resilience in the face of climate change will be addressed.

It also had 39,500 hectares of land planted to abaca in that year1. With the continued introduction of new applications and other significant uses, abaca strengthen its position as one of the major crops in the country with high export potential and continues to be one of the main sources of income among farmers in the region. 

Through the years, the productions of abaca were drastically going down because of the infestation of abaca diseases and natural calamities that hits the region. Several abaca areas are now unproductive because of slow rehabilitation activities due to lack of fund for this purpose.

Through the DHIP, the breeding program of the carabaos at the local level will have a clear direction and its progress is measured over time to ensure that the animals are improving in terms of breeding performance. The DHIP is fairly inexpensive, useful and exciting activity that only requires constant monitoring and evaluation including documentation of activities.

In addition, the dairy herd improvement (DHI) system has a played a critical role in the advancement of the dairy industry.  Even today, it remains an important link in the industry. However, dairy industry changes, such as animal number decreases and shifts, dairy management advances, and on-farm economics, pose significant challenges to DHI. The nature of the dairy market, changing technology, and competitive pressures indicate the need for strategic planning and implementation among DHI participants, players and stakeholders.

This scheme will ensure the survival of abaca which is indigenous to the Philippines. Using a corporative approach, the project aims to organize and empower most of the abaca farmers nationwide as a cooperative, produce their own abaca fibers as a group which will redound to better competitive price, quality and quantity and sell their harvest directly to Grading and Baling Establishments (GBEs) and local processors. A group of abaca farmers with contiguous abaca farms for at least one hectare per farmer shall be formed into a cooperative with at least 100 active farmer-members and should be accredited with the Department of Agriculture (DA).  This project also aims to reduce the activity being done by the farmers to increase their productivity. The traditional way of abaca fiber extraction/harvesting by the abaca farmers has twelve (12) stages.  The project intends to lessen it to only six (6) steps --Topping, Tumbling, Tuxying, Tuxy Bundling, Tuxy Transporting/Hauling and Tuxy Trading /Selling --  thereby removing and easing the burden of the abaca farmers of the other six (6) activities and just let them continue producing all the abaca tuxies they want for the day before selling it to their cooperative that same day. This will surely increase abaca fiber production.

The project has an estimated budgetary requirement of about P20 million to cover the warehouse, stripping, drying and office buildings, equipment and facilities, hauling truck and motorcycles and seed capital for the initial operation. Feasibility study and logical framework was conducted and formulated thus, ready for takeoff once budget is available.

Tapping is the most costly activity in natural rubber production and the shortage of tappers is a serious problem in rubber plantations in the country. Low Frequency Tapping (LFT) systems are considered to be a solution to these issues by reducing the number of tappers required while increasing tappers' income.

Therefore, the need to improve the productivity and competitiveness of rubber cultivation is compulsory such as reduction of tapping labor and applying low tapping frequencies that may lessen the operational cost and can increase the marginal profit of rubber farmers. This activity will be compensated by the increase of hormonal stimulation by providing latex stimulant. With this tapping orientation, the profit of rubber tappers may increase since they will not solely depend on rubber tapping as their source of income.",19,0,2021-05001-000204,Region Specific,9,['9'],['80'],1,2,1,1,,1,1,0,0,,[],[],[],,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,1,"(1) Project was approved during PRRI Collegial Review;

The significant plantations in the Philippines are located in Zamboanga Peninsula. On the other hand, wastewater treatment is becoming more critical because of the diminishing water resources, increasing cost of wastewater disposal, and firmer regulations in connection to the contaminant levels in waste streams. 

Adsorption technique is an efficient process for the treatment of wastewater from various industrial plants. But this technique highly relies on the used adsorbent. The low-cost adsorbent should be easily available, abundant in nature, or a waste product from industrial and agricultural sectors.

Information needed in the implementation of these programs is dispersed to all provincial and regional offices. Obtaining such information from one office to another may cause some difficulty and a possible duplication of efforts in maintaining similar systems and/or databases across different field offices occurs due to the geographical concerns. Obviously, there is a need to integrate information sources and build-up an agency-wide knowledge databank and up-to-date web portal to ensure easy access to updated, relevant and timely information. Improvement of electronic links within the organization as well as with the other external entities is also necessary. 

Data and information systems on the geographical location of programs and projects of the agency presented in electronic maps are also needed to be developed for effective monitoring and to reduce the need for clients to physically go to PhilFIDA offices to avail of services or obtain the information they need. An improved internal system can be better delivered through the use of latest technologies on intranet and extranet solutions, particularly through web-enabled applications.

Voice and data communication technologies can manage coordinative works between central office and different provincial and regional offices. Centralized system within the agency will further enhance productivity through web-enabled applications.
