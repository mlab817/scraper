The project will allocate GEF resources strategically to 1) engage major seafood buyers in the main world markets (EU, Japan, US) into responsible sourcing, providing tools to prepare and implement sustainable seafood sourcing policies, 2) adapt the concept of green commodities platforms in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia and Philippines to generate experience that could be used in other countries, 3) support stakeholders of these platforms to develop practical experience with fisheries improvement projects and upgrade existing tools for FIP implementation and monitoring, and 4) upgrade existing information platforms to facilitate access to reliable materials to value chain stakeholders in support of sound decision making, and capturing documenting and disseminating the learnings of the project. The project target fisheries include tuna fisheries in the Pacific Ocean, Mahi-mahi and large pelagic fish in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, Indonesian snapper, Octopus and blue swimming crab fisheries in Philippines.

1. Establishment of Dairy Marketing Centers 
a. These marketing centers, equipped with chillers, shall be established within existing NDA-assisted dairy zones or dairy areas. It must be situated in strategic areas or commercial centers where local consumers can easily access the products. 
b. Dairy farmers can go to these dairy marketing centers to sell their products. Since smallhold dairy farmers will undergo capability training on home based processing, they will be able to process their own products, sell through these marketing centers and earn more income.  
c.  The NDA will initially oversee the center under its Business Development Unit and eventually tap the NDA trained personnel of the Federation or dairy cooperatives to manage or run the centers. The dairy cooperatives/federations/private entities shall pay corresponding commissioned-based fees to NDA for every product sold in the center. The fees collected will go back to the marketing centers to cover the maintenance costs.
d. NDA will continuously monitor the marketing centers.

2. Establishment of Dairy Post-harvest facilities 
a. Post-harvest facilities such as milk collection centers with cold storage equipment shall be established to ensure the quality of milk collected for processing plants. 
b. Farmers can go to these collection centers and sell their raw milk produce and the collection center will bring the milk to the milk processing plant.
c. The NDA will establish these milk collection centers and shall be leased (Lease to own scheme) to cooperatives or federations.
d. Through a partnership forged between the federation or cooperatives and the marketing center thru NDA, products from the milk processing plants will be supplied to the marketing centers.

B. Capacity Building

As the country recognizes the need to develop its dairy industry, priority programs such as training programs for dairy farmers and cooperatives shall be enhanced. Dairy sector’s competiveness and capacities will be fully strengthened in the country as extension services will continue to magnify its horizons by providing adequate and timely training and education. The following trainings will be conducted:
a. Homebased Milk Processing
b. Milk Quality Assurance
c. Business Management (Accounting & Bookkeeping)
d. Milk Marketing
e. Trainings on other business opportunities (meat processing (for male calves), vermi-culture, biogas, forage production)

This project aims to enhance existing dairy-based livelihood particularly on milk collection, processing and marketing to make dairying a sustainable source of income for dairy farmers.

• Joint Policy Research in Philippine Dairy Development Policy and Regulation. Dairy experts from Korea and Philippines and if necessary, with possible involvement of other ASAN and Asia Pacific resource persons, who shall jointly collaborate to review existing Philippine dairy policies and issuances, and come up with recommended courses of actions.
• The most critical areas which include dairy production, processing and marketing will be studied to find critical issues and problems and how to solve them. Results will be used as baseline data for further collaborative projects which may include infrastructure and technology development.

Component 2: Knowledge Sharing
• Short-term Trainings on 
   a. Dairy Policy Analysis and Development in Korea and 
   b. Dairy Regulation Standard Settings & Review in the Philippines.
   c. Dairy Extension and Dissemination Strategies on critical areas in production, processing and marketing.
• Country-industry Mission/Visits on successful public and private dairy enterprises in Korea and Philippines.
• Country-industry workshops on Dairy Development Policy and Review Collaboration.

Component 3: Dairy Project Identification and Development
• Project shortlisting and conceptualization workshops.
• Project proposal preparation.

Through this project, the dairy sector’s competiveness and capacities will also be fully strengthened in the country as extension services will continue to magnify its horizons by providing adequate and timely training and education. These are some of the areas that needs improvement in order to speed up, accelerate and increase dairy productivity and the number of farmers involved in the industry.

9753,NDA - Dairy Goat Farming: A Livelihood Opportunity for Rural Farm families,2,0,['7'],"The proposed program will revolve around a community dairy goat farming concept. In this concept, communities will be identified where dairy goat farms will be established and will function as a goat multiplier farm, dairy production area, and learning site. In this arrangement, farmers will raise the animals given to them by the program in a common area with complete facilities and provision of necessary implements. They will be assisted too in the marketing through the program initiatives.

The implementation of the program will be by module, wherein one beneficiary community will receive one. A module of this program will have the following components: 100 breeder does and 5 breeder bucks; 1 goat house; Developed pasture; Milking and milk processing and storage equipment; Farm implements; Barn and storage; Starting feeds, drugs, and biologics; and Training of recipients.

The beneficiaries shall provide an agricultural land area (minimum of 4 hectares) for the project as a counterpart. The daily operations and accompanying costs of operation will be shouldered by the beneficiaries. The farmer beneficiaries and their families will operate the farm, each owning 10 heads of does. The milk produced will be processed in the farm and will be marketed as a whole. Income will then be divided among the beneficiaries depending on the volume of their production on a day-to-day basis.

In the aspect of marketing, the program had included the milk-feeding strategy to ensure a ready market for the milk produced by the farms. The milk-feeding concept will be an outfit that will buy the milks produced and processed by the modules and bring it for milk-feeding programs for malnourished children in the locality. With this set-up, the program will not only resolve the market obstacle, but will help address malnutrition among children.

This is designed to safeguard the project and the animals from threats like non-compliance of beneficiaries, lack of resources, and poor monitoring and to ensure that the targets are achieved and the recipients will experience the impact of the program in their lives.",19,0,2020-05001-000142,Interregional,14,"['15', '1', '2', '3', '40', '41', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14']",['17'],1,1,0,1,,1,1,0,0,,['6'],['18'],['3'],"Implementation Risk as follows:
