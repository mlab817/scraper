Rural Development Project","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["1","2","4","5","6"],"description":"PRDP is a six-year national government platform for a modern and climate-smart agriculture to be pursued through partnerships with local government units and agri-fishery stakeholders. It will take-off from the gains and lessons of various DA programs such as project tracking by geo-tagging and building capacity of LGUs and farming and fishing communities to manage and sustain agri-fishery support infrastructure and services, among others.\nThe Project will operationalize the national and regional Agriculture and Fishery Modernization Plans (AFMPs) through integration of plans at the provincial level. Also, the Project will be guided by the vulnerability and suitability assessment framework, which was initially used for the Central Philippines Rural Development Project (CPRDP) preparation. Also, it will develop value chain roadmaps that will serve as an input in the selection and prioritization of investments in the target areas.\n\nThe Project is aligned with the goals and priorities of the Philippine Development Plans (2011-2016) for a competitive and sustainable agriculture and fisheries sectors, will provide program-level support for the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997 (RA 8435) and advances the principles of Agrikulturang Pinoy (AgriPinoy) of sustainable resource management, local development and full service delivery from farm to table.\n\nLocal Planning: this component aims to enhance the Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Plan through science-based tools and to harmonize regional and provincial Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plan through the formulation of the Provincial Commodity Investment Plan using value chain approach.\n\nInfrastructure Development: this component aims to improve the links from production areas to markets to enhance the efficiency of transporting agricultural products. It also aims for higher productivity as a result of increased cropping intensity and yields, food security and improved health from readily available potable water and lower post harvest losses resulting in higher volume of outputs and more efficient support facilities.\n\nEnterprise Development: this component aims to engage broad sections of the sector in the production of marketable surplus through investments in strategic segments of priority commodity value chains and strengthening collaboration between DA and the Local Government Units. It shall strengthen and develop viable agri-fishery based enterprises through efficient value chain of key regional agri-fishery product.\n\nProject Support: this component aims to provide efficient and effective project management and implementation, establish a standard on services and technical assistance and effective mode of engagement with LGUs.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2020-05001-000041","spatial":"Interregional","region":"14","states_id":["15","1","2","3","40","41","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14"],"provinces_id":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22","23","24","25","26","27","28","29","30","31","32","33","34","35","36","37","38","39","40","41","42","43","44","45","46","48","49","50","51","52","53","54","55","56","57","58","59","60","61","62","63","64","65","66","67","68","69","70","71","72","73","74","75","76","77","78","81","82","83","88"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"1","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"1","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"1","rdc_date_endorsement":"2016-04-12","sectors":["3","4","6"],"subsectors":["7","12","13","18"],"status":["7"],"risk":"(1) Project Stakeholders: The risks associated with resistance and\/or slow uptake of the institutional reforms in the DA on which PRDP is built on appears to be diminishing as project implementation proceeds. The Project through the Local and National Level Planning Component will release a Harmonized Planning and Budgeting Manual. that will encompass planning & Budgeting, investment planning and monitoring and evaluation manuals. This will be distributed to all DA offices, agencies, bureau, corporation. others. (2) Governance of the Implementing Agency: The risk of governance issues within the DA and as they relate to LGUs in implementing the PRDP are increasingly diminishing as implementation of the Project gathers momentum. A high degree of staff, unit\/bureau and attached agency support has been developed through active program of institutional and stakeholder assessments, workshop and briefings.

Crops Development Act of 1995). This is an act to promote the production, processing, marketing and distribution of high value crops. HVCDP is a priority program of the Department of Agriculture created to help address food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable growth through increased farm income and productivity. The target service areas include convergence areas, strategic production zones and farm households. These areas need the interventions from the government in terms of production, extension, processing, marketing and regulatory support. The program is implemented yearly with a coverage of implementation down to barangay levels. The budgetary allocation for the implementation of PAP for the HVCDP is taken from the GAA with a cost sharing arrangement scheme. A specific guidelines in the PAPs implementation is being followed  by the DA RFUs together with partner implementers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \nComponents of the Program include:\n i.

poverty, the DA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SAAD was conceptualized. It intends to contribute in alleviating poverty through increased food production and establishment of community enterprises in the target areas by providing the appropriate technology, marketing, and other support services in order to make the farmers and fisherfolk productive and profitable.\n\nGenerally, the Program hopes to help alleviate poverty in the areas where it operates through the provision of agricultural and related interventions to the farming and fisheries sector.

project that will be implemented by the  DA-BPI under a  Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Agricultural Project with Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and Korean private companies . The project aims to enhance production competitiveness of small and mid-sized farmers by establishing greenhouse technology for high value added agro-products, and increase farmers income by enhancing distribution channel in related to co-branding and local shipping in the Philippines.   The Korean Smart Farm Greenhouses offers the Philippine agriculture a possible solution to the country's climate change concern being experienced by our highland vegetable growers. It would be also a showcase for Good Agricultural Practice, addressing the food safety requirements in the Food Safety Law in the country.   The piloting of the Korean Style Greenhouse is also an avenue to get the advance climate proof greenhouse technology which can be utilized in organic crop production, and eventually gain an easy access to Korean market to boost Philippine agriculture. Aside from the productivity, the established operating software  will provide greenhouse environment information to farmers by mobile to help them manage operating risk. Also, the environmental and production data collected through the software will guide to establish environmental control system optimized in the local environment of the Philippines.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2020-05001-000070","spatial":"Region Specific","region":"15","states_id":["15"],"provinces_id":["13"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"1","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"1","iccable":"1","updates":"Ongoing.

functions per R.A. 9242, s. 2004, and the need to supply the requirement for raw materials of local weavers and knitters make the support to the Philippine fiber industry imperative.    \n\nCotton, as a primary component of home-made fabrics, having been grown for long in the country as an industry, is among the major fibers that need to be revitalized and sustained. The Philippines used to produce cotton supplying a portion of the need of the textile mills in the country. Highest production was attained in 1992 when area planted to cotton reached 35,000 hectares and produced 14,400 MT raw cotton fiber (cotton lint). However, due to serious economic and technical considerations on cotton growing in recent years, there had been a substantial decline in hectarage and participation in the industry, with areas just primarily confined in research stations to date. \n\n In as much as a home-grown cotton production technology had been developed, along with the availability of physical resources that convert cotton harvests into raw fiber, waiting to be refurbished for immediate use, cotton cultivation and processing can be sustained with proper support from the government. \n\nTo revitalize the cotton industry in order to sustain the production of cotton fibers for small-scale cotton users, such as local loom-weavers and knitters, and eventually for commercial-size cotton production and
