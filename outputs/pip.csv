It will take-off from the gains and lessons of various DA programs such as project tracking by geo-tagging and building capacity of LGUs and farming and fishing communities to manage and sustain agri-fishery support infrastructure and services, among others.
The Project will operationalize the national and regional Agriculture and Fishery Modernization Plans (AFMPs) through integration of plans at the provincial level. Also, the Project will be guided by the vulnerability and suitability assessment framework, which was initially used for the Central Philippines Rural Development Project (CPRDP) preparation. Also, it will develop value chain roadmaps that will serve as an input in the selection and prioritization of investments in the target areas.

The Project is aligned with the goals and priorities of the Philippine Development Plans (2011-2016) for a competitive and sustainable agriculture and fisheries sectors, will provide program-level support for the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997 (RA 8435) and advances the principles of Agrikulturang Pinoy (AgriPinoy) of sustainable resource management, local development and full service delivery from farm to table.

Local Planning: this component aims to enhance the Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Plan through science-based tools and to harmonize regional and provincial Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plan through the formulation of the Provincial Commodity Investment Plan using value chain approach.

Infrastructure Development: this component aims to improve the links from production areas to markets to enhance the efficiency of transporting agricultural products. It also aims for higher productivity as a result of increased cropping intensity and yields, food security and improved health from readily available potable water and lower post harvest losses resulting in higher volume of outputs and more efficient support facilities.

9434,High Value Crops Development Program,1,1,"['1', '2', '4']","High Value Crops Development Program (HVCDP) is in line with the Republic Act 7900 (High Value Crops Development Act of 1995). This is an act to promote the production, processing, marketing and distribution of high value crops. HVCDP is a priority program of the Department of Agriculture created to help address food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable growth through increased farm income and productivity. The target service areas include convergence areas, strategic production zones and farm households. These areas need the interventions from the government in terms of production, extension, processing, marketing and regulatory support. The program is implemented yearly with a coverage of implementation down to barangay levels. The budgetary allocation for the implementation of PAP for the HVCDP is taken from the GAA with a cost sharing arrangement scheme. A specific guidelines in the PAPs implementation is being followed  by the DA RFUs together with partner implementers.

Cotton, as a primary component of home-made fabrics, having been grown for long in the country as an industry, is among the major fibers that need to be revitalized and sustained. The Philippines used to produce cotton supplying a portion of the need of the textile mills in the country. Highest production was attained in 1992 when area planted to cotton reached 35,000 hectares and produced 14,400 MT raw cotton fiber (cotton lint). However, due to serious economic and technical considerations on cotton growing in recent years, there had been a substantial decline in hectarage and participation in the industry, with areas just primarily confined in research stations to date. 

 In as much as a home-grown cotton production technology had been developed, along with the availability of physical resources that convert cotton harvests into raw fiber, waiting to be refurbished for immediate use, cotton cultivation and processing can be sustained with proper support from the government.

5. Disapproval of proposed establishment or rehabilitation of facilities/equipment to complement the implementation of existing projects such as fingerlings production and fish landing centers.
6. Limited manpower in the Provincial Fisheries Offices to conduct monitoring and evaluation of project beneficiaries.

Mitigation Strategies:

1. Encourage community participation in the fabrication of some projects such as fiberglass boats to avoid bulk procurement.
