An inclusive and globally competitive rubber industry providing sustainable benefits to all stakeholders is envisioned for the Philippine rubber industry, with the goal of increasing the benefits of all the stakeholders, thereby spreading the gains down to the smallholders in the remote barangays in all rubber producing provinces in the regions. For the past year, low production of rubber yield emerges as a major constraint in the rubber industry which is mainly attributed in low pricing, in addition the improper fertilization management/nutrient management, emergence of pests and diseases, uses of unsuited rubber clones for plantation, lack of information on rubber clone agronomic characteristics and natural calamities. The development of technologies to support decision-making in production, pricing, good agricultural practices, market, pest and diseases management. The derived information will be useful for the farmers, planners, and researchers. Philippines Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) needs timely accurate statistics on natural rubber regularly to monitor and to take suitable measures in the interest of the Philippines rubber sector.	

Generally, this study will enable the Philippine Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) to map the areas vulnerable to soil erosion, estimating the area for further cultivation, and clone suitability map through GIS and Remote Sensing technologies. Furthermore this study will assess the spatial distribution of rubber area over different classes of elevation and slope and the traditional rubber clone’s farmer’s preference, it will help to fully understand the dynamics of rubber plantation activity in the rubber traditional regions of the Philippines and understanding the variation in the productivity of rubber ecosystem in the Philippines.",19,0,2021-05001-000249,Interregional,14,"['9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14']","['2', '3', '9', '16', '21', '26', '27', '28', '29', '30', '41', '42', '44', '48', '49', '66', '69', '71', '72', '73', '74', '76', '78', '79', '80', '81', '82', '83', '88']",1,1,0,1,,1,1,0,0,,['5'],[],['9'],"Implementation Risks: Slow to non - participation of the rubber farmer to thier responsibilities of the project.

32412,NDA - Farm Mechanization,2,0,"['4', '7']","Dairy farming today requires the use of farm machineries and equipment which are considered valuable inputs particularly in forage production and pasture development.  While such equipment offers a wide range of benefits in terms of developing and increasing production of forage for dairy animals, not all dairy farmers have the capacity to purchase their own equipment taking into account the financial obligations that they need to fulfil in managing their respective farms.

As the agency mandated to accelerate the development of the local dairy industry, the NDA is committed to providing the local dairy farmers the access to various dairy equipment and facilities that can be of great help in improving their dairy farm operations. It is in this light, that the NDA would like to propose the provision of one (1) agricultural tractor, one (1) forage chopper, one (1) truck, and one (1) warehouse to each of the six (6) Regional Departments of the NDA namely, Northern Luzon, Southern Luzon, Central Visayas, Western Visayas, Northern Mindanao and Southern Mindanao. 

The NDA shall be the executing agency of the project whose major tasks include: formulating rules and guidelines as regards to the use of the tractor and forage chopper; deployment of the equipment to the requesting farmers/farmers' groups; overall maintenance of the equipment; and conduct of regular monitoring of the project. 

The NDA uses this proposed project as the vehicle to support local dairy farmers in their goal of further enhancing dairy farm operations to achieve better milk yield and ensuring the availability of feeds for dairy animals. In addition, the agency seeks to develop more contract growers to serve as feeds source of the local dairy farmers and contract growers for specialized skills in calf rearing and grow-out farming. 

The tractors, trucks, and forage choppers would be provided on hire basis to the local dairy farmers through the NDA Regional Department assisting them. Each department shall be responsible in ensuring the equity in the distribution of assistance to the farmers.

The project will enhance farm operations and increase forage production of local dairy farmers. It also aims to develop more contract growers as feeds source.",19,0,2021-05001-000254,Interregional,11,"['3', '40', '7', '10', '11']","['12', '17', '25', '29', '81']",1,1,0,1,,1,1,0,0,,[],[],[],,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,1,No project fund as of September 2019.

Specifically, the sub-program component undertakes the following;1.1 Design/development/improvement of  machines/tools/devices;  1.2.  Identification of new uses for natural fibers to promote their utilization development and identification of new uses for natural fibers to promote their utilization in line with environment  conciousness for green economy and utilization of renewable resources; 1.3  Raw material manipulation of fibers to create a variety of different effects using fibers, fabrics and other materials for the different fiber properties 1.4 Disseminate developed  technologies as technology source for community -based livelihood project in coordination with ESETS. The Fiber Utilization and Technology Division (FUTD) personnel who developed the technologies acted as Resource Speaker in disseminating  the techniques, cost and return analysis and sustainability approaches for each recipient association/organization/cooperative to develop them into a   business enterprise as source of livelihood.
1.4  Laboratory services on fiber identification, analysis of morphological, physical and chemical properties of fibers are undertaken to cater to the needs of the industry stakeholders such as the farmers, cordage makers, pulp processors and trade exporters of raw fibers. The Fiber Processing and Utilization Laboratory (FPUL) provides state-of-the-art capabilities for the testing and study of natural fibers emphasizing the characteristics to achieve desired fiber properties and functions.  It is a science-based user facility simultaneously developing strong scientific programs while offering broad access to its capabilities and collaboration. The FPUL can assist the businesses in complying with the requests needed.  The sectors that would most likely support the upgrading of the FPUL are the farmers, fiber processors, academe, private businessmen and LGUs. In all cases, the local government units always request FPUL for technical assistance in terms of value-adding activities and income generation/employment opportunities.  These activities can easily be adapted by their constituents because of the following reasons: a.  Doable and can be considered as a backyard industry b.  Developed products

32688,RFO XIII - Risk Resiliency Program (RRP),2,0,['5'],"The program is composed of Integrated/sustainable Farming System, expansion of Livestock Multiplier Farms and supplement the crop diversification of Surigao del Sur.

Component 1 - Alternative Livelihood Program
The project aims to achieve the following:
1. Introduce farming system to more or less 150 hectares riceland and increase harvest in less expenses;
2. Enhancing the operations of the provincial small ruminants multiplier farms;
3. Enhancement of Provincial Plant Nursery Operations

Component 2 - Surigao del Norte Climate-Smart Agri-Fishery Program
The project aims to achieve the following:
1. Reduce the impacts of climate change to the agri-fishery sector through establishment of greenhouse and tunnel houses;
2. Boost crop and aqua-marine production in the province through new climate-smart technologies;
3. Build a climate-resilient farming and fishing communities in Surigao del Norte through capacity building in Farmer Field Schools

Component 3 - Dinagat Islands Sustainable Agriculture and Fisheries Program:
The project aims to achieve the following:
1. Avert socio-economic dislodgment cause by unexpected catastrophic events.
2. To ensure better chances of survival in times of untoward disaster.  
3. To introduce and promote appropriate, suitable and sustainable livelihood program and projects.
4. To improve and Increase farm-family household productivity and profitability.
5. Generate employment in the rural communities.
6. Capacitate farmers and peoples’ organization through trainings on package of applicable technology

Component 4: Construction of Small Water Impounding Dam and Water System. 
1. To help small farm holders conserve water through installation of rainwater catchments to sustain crop production.
