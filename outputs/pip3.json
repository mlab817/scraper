Sisal Development Project","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["1","5","8"],"description":"Sisal is wildly and sporadically growing in almost all of the provinces of Central Visayas, specifically in the provinces of Cebu and Siquijor.  In most cases, it is traditionally grown along hedges to demarcate farm boundaries, and to produce fiber ropes for farm use and\/or to supplement incomes.  It can be observed that such fibercrop thrive well in the harsh conditions and mostly in the unproductive and marginal land in the said provinces, being a drought resistance perennial crops.  If properly introduce and adopted, sisal farming can be a good alternative livelihood for farmers whose farm cannot be utilized to cultivate food crops -  such as, corn, rootcrop, etc., that the most farmers in this provinces traditional produced.  Its production requires virtually no external inputs (i.e. fertilizer, insecticides, and\/or pesticides) after planting and provides protection against soil erosion.  The leaves used for fiber production can be harvested continuously throughout the year for roughly 15-year period without replanting it and allows farmers to harvest whenever the need for additional income is at the highest.  As such, it can support sustainable agriculture initiative of the community by sustaining the economic viability of farm operation, enhancing the environmental quality, the natural resources base upon which the agricultural economy as well as the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole.  In addition, it can from part of the overall solution to climate change.   Thus, this project is being proposed and will be known as Sisal Development Project primarily aimed to provide alternative livelihood and sustain economic activities to our people in the countryside thru sisal farming and help augment their standard of living.  \n        Components of this project shall include the Establishment of Sisal Nurseries in six (6) different locations to sustain the planting materials need of the beneficiaries.  Likewise, planting materials production and distribution to support the development of new sisal production areas and of course with institutional strengthening through Training and Education, that includes the conduct of Training of Trainers (TOTs) for LGU Technicians and farmer leaders as well as the LGU-led Livelihood Training to capacitate the identified LGUs, farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s association and farmer-beneficiaries.\n        This project is a collaborative undertaking of partner agencies like PhilFIDA, Department of Agriculture, Local Government Units (Municipal and Provincial LGU) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), in order to maximize resources, work hand in hand geared towards one and common desire to give the best possible service to our clientele.\n\nThe main purpose of this project is to uplift the quality of life of our people in the countryside through increased productivity and real income by insuring stability of the fiber industry in the country.  It specifically aims to;\n(1)  develop an aggregate of two hundred ten (210) hectares sisal areas in the provinces of Bohol (30-ha), Cebu (75-ha), Negros Oriental (30-ha), and Siquijor (75-ha.);\n(2) establish six (6) hectares Sisal Nurseries as source of planting material needs of the beneficiaries for the development of new sisal production areas in the targeted provinces;\n(3) produce and distribute at least 882,000 sisal planting materials (propagated sisal bulbils and suckers) to the target farmer-beneficiaries during implementation period; and\n(4) capacitate the Stakeholders (LGU and farmer-beneficiaries) through conduct of Packaged of Technology (POT) on Sisal production from farm establishment to its cultural practices up to harvesting and its post-harvest practices as well as fiber quality improvement technologies.  \n(5) Ten (10) hectares of sisal is to be planted in Region I to supply the needs of the local pulp

certified abaca cultivation area from 0 ha to 500 ha at the end and increase average yearly income of abaca farmers with certification by 10%. Results include: \n\n- The production output of abaca fibres was increased up from 10 kg of fiber\/day to 120 kg\/day following the provision of simple machines that make it easier for the smallholder farmers to extract the fibres from the leaf sheaths. This contributed to the increase in income of the farmers. \n\n- A total of 36 smallholder farmers have been Rainforest Alliance certified on 149 ha of agricultural land (500 ha originally planned). \n\nThe present strategic alliance aims to harness the results and lessons learnt for the diversification and expansion of the Abaca Sustainability Initiative (ASI), i.e. knowledge and experience are to be disseminated to new regions and firmly established with a view to achieve a broad impact and promoting structure-building results. \n\nUnder ASI+, the approach is to be extended. The proven concept of GIZ's Farmer Business School approach will be introduced to promote the entrepreneurial skills and business management capacity of the smallholder farmers and their organizations in order to identify opportunities for enhancing their business operations and incomes. In addition, applied abaca research will be resumed, and the task of promoting resilience in the face of climate change will be addressed.

The database contains information on farmers, farm laborers, and fishermen and their farm parcel. The database can significantly improve the delivery of programs and services of the Department of Agriculture while making the data available to other agencies that share the same stakeholders as the DA.\n\nIt includes conduct of nationwide validation and registration of farmers and updating of the existing farmers registry.\n\nThis project also includes printing and distribution of  farmer's intervention card that will serve as a single and standard identification system for all registered farmers. The farmer's ID card can be used as a first level validation and authentication of DA beneficiaries.\n\nAlong with the ID card, this project will also provide a Farmer's Passbook \/ booklet  that list down all the interventions that the farmers can avail from DA. The booklet will also act as the farmer's own record book of his farming activities.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2020-05001-000172","spatial":"Nationwide","region":"","states_id":[],"provinces_id":[],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"2","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"1","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"2","iccable":"1","updates":"Ongoing negotiation with partner-agencies on the mode of implementation.

planning and developmental policies and guidelines. These may include activities relevant to integrated coastal zone planning focusing on Fisheries Management Areas (FMAs) using Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM), vulnerable areas of the coast including fishing communities, and nearshore areas using the results of Fisheries Vulnerability\/Suitability Assessment Tool (FishVOOL) conducted by NFRDI\n\nComponent 2: Fisheries and Coastal-Resilient Resource Management (FishCRRM) - supports management of coastal and marine resources to promote resiliency and sustainable fisheries. Activities under consideration include institutional and procedural strengthening of Marine Protected Areas and coastal habitats; management of fish stocks using modern technologies; development of coastal vegetation, and co-management of municipal waters with coastal communities, law enforcement and certification on fisheries sustainability and traceability\n\nComponent 3: Modern and Resilient Fisheries and Aquaculture Enterprises, Infrastructure and Support Facilities - supports modernization of fisheries and aquaculture enterprises throughout the value supply chain including investments on climate-resilient infrastructure, support facilities, system development, credit and insurance access, and logistics. Activities under consideration include development, management and modernization of aquaculture and capture fisheries; adoption of climate-smart production technologies, enhanced entrepreneurial support along with investment in post-harvest facilities, logistics, and improved compliance with manufacturing and food safety and quality standards\n\nComponent 4: Project Management and Coordination\nThe Project Management and Coordination will be set up in the BFAR will be responsible for the everyday activity for this program. It will also coordinate with various implementing agencies and NGOs, and liaise with the funding agency. There will also be an establishment of Project Implementation Units (PIU) at the Regional Fisheries Office that will oversee and be responsible in the field implementation of the activities. As the contribution of the recipient communities and LGUs, FMA Units will be created to coordinate activities with the PMC and the PIU. As a result, the effective and sustainable implementation of the project will be sustained.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2020-05001-000306","spatial":"Nationwide","region":"","states_id":[],"provinces_id":[],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"1","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"3","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":["6"],"subsectors":["19"],"status":["9"],"risk":"Not yet identified.

This valuable tool helps evaluate the progress of the herd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s milk production while addressing the improvement of the different production management system including breeding, health and nutrition. Through the DHIP, the breeding program of the carabaos at the local level will have a clear direction and its progress is measured over time to ensure that the animals are improving in terms of breeding performance. The DHIP is fairly inexpensive, useful and exciting activity that only requires constant monitoring and evaluation including documentation of activities.\n\nIn addition, the dairy herd improvement (DHI) system has a played a critical role in the advancement of the dairy industry.  Even today, it remains an important link in the industry. However, dairy industry changes, such as animal number decreases and shifts, dairy management advances, and on-farm economics, pose significant challenges to DHI. The nature of the dairy market, changing technology, and competitive pressures indicate the need for strategic planning and implementation among DHI participants, players and stakeholders.\n\nThe project is expected to benefit some 150,000 dairy farmers and 190 organized groups.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000188","spatial":"Interregional","region":"13","states_id":["1","2","3","40","41","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13"],"provinces_id":["2","3","4","5","6","11","12","14","15","16","18","19","20","21","22","23","24","25","26","27","28","29","30","31","32","34","35","36","37","39","40","41","43","45","46","48","49","51","52","53","55","56","57","58","60","61","62","63","64","65","66","67","68","69","70","71","73","74","78","79","80","81","82","83"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"2","rd":"1","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"1","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"2","iccable":"1","updates":"The project has been presented to the DA-wide Clearinghouse Committee.

- Expanded Capacity Development Program for Rubber Farmers Association and Cooperatives","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["4","5","7","8"],"description":"With the recent technological advancements happening in the rubber industry, rubber stakeholders must be capacitated in order to address the need to increase production and be able to obtain a generous monthly income.  Production is not the sole problem that remains to be addressed, but also the low income of smallholders which is by far the rallying cry of every rubber farmer from now and then. Hence, this program aims to address this seemingly insurable crisis in the Philippine rubber economy.  Republic Act 10089 states, \"undertake training and capacity-building programs for rubber producers, processors and cooperatives in order to increase production of quality rubber and raises level of income especially of poor smallholders.\" Given this function, PRRI shall conduct trainings\/seminars\/workshops to essentially capacitate the rubber smallholders, specifically the rubber farmers so that they will be alleviated from their former state of only earning meager income. Training to be conducted will enhance the knowledge and skills of rubber farmers in rubber plantation, and nursery and bud wood garden establishment and management, harvesting and post-harvesting of rubber to increase the productivity and improve the quality of rubber thus increase the income of rubber farmers.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000202","spatial":"Interregional","region":"14","states_id":["2","40","41","7","9","10","11","12","13","14"],"provinces_id":["9","16","27","29","52","58","61","69","73","74","80"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"2","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"2","iccable":"1","updates":"Approved

- Abaca Tuxy Buying Special Project (ATBSP)","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["3"],"description":"The Abaca Tuxy Buying Special Project (ATBSP) is the new approach to be implemented by the Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority (PhilFIDA) in the production of excellent abaca fiber. This scheme will ensure the survival of abaca which is indigenous to the Philippines. Using a corporative approach, the project aims to organize and empower most of the abaca farmers nationwide as a cooperative, produce their own abaca fibers as a group which will redound to better competitive price, quality and quantity and sell their harvest directly to Grading and Baling Establishments (GBEs) and local processors. A group of abaca farmers with contiguous abaca farms for at least one hectare per farmer shall be formed into a cooperative with at least 100 active farmer-members and should be accredited with the Department of Agriculture (DA).  This project also aims to reduce the activity being done by the farmers to increase their productivity. The traditional way of abaca fiber extraction\/harvesting by the abaca farmers has twelve (12) stages.  The project intends to lessen it to only six (6) steps --Topping, Tumbling, Tuxying, Tuxy Bundling, Tuxy Transporting\/Hauling and Tuxy Trading \/Selling --  thereby removing and easing the burden of the abaca farmers of the other six (6) activities and just let them continue producing all the abaca tuxies they want for the day before selling it to their cooperative that same day. This will surely increase abaca fiber production.\n\nThe project has an estimated budgetary requirement of about P20 million to cover the warehouse, stripping, drying and office buildings, equipment and facilities, hauling truck and motorcycles and seed capital for the initial operation. Feasibility study and logical framework was conducted and formulated thus, ready for takeoff once budget is available.\n\nATBSP is aligned to the newly approved Abaca Industry Roadmap of PhilFIDA. It is expected to meet the demand for the high-quality abaca fibers and uplift the status of life of abaca farmers most specially the indigenous people in rural

- Production Performance of Matured Rubber Trees Applied with Low Tapping Frequency at Varrying Levels of Latex Stimulants","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["4","5","7","8"],"description":"The cultivation of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) in the Philippines is predominantly played by small rubber farmers holding only three hectares or less. With the unstable current market price of natural rubber latex, most tappers seek other income generating activity to augment the families\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 basic needs that solely depend on rubber latex production. Thus, the rubber industry is facing a scarcity of skilled tapper laborers. Tapping is the most costly activity in natural rubber production and the shortage of tappers is a serious problem in rubber plantations in the country. Low Frequency Tapping (LFT) systems are considered to be a solution to these issues by reducing the number of tappers required while increasing tappers' income.\n\nTherefore, the need to improve the productivity and competitiveness of rubber cultivation is compulsory such as reduction of tapping labor and applying low tapping frequencies that may lessen the operational cost and can increase the marginal profit of rubber farmers. This activity will be compensated by the increase of hormonal stimulation by providing latex stimulant. With this tapping orientation, the profit of rubber tappers may increase since they will not solely depend on rubber tapping as their source of income.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000204","spatial":"Region

- Screening of Introduced Hevea brasiliensis Clones and Hevea camargoana Species for Susceptibility and Resistance Under Corynespora Leaf Fall Disease Induced Condition","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["4","5","7","8"],"description":"Corynespora Leaf Fall Disease (CLFD) caused by a fungal pathogen Corynespora cassiicola is one of the major diseases which poses serious threat to natural rubber production in rubber growing countries of South and South East Asia (Edathil et.al. 2000).This disease is regularly causing more damage in any plant growth stages (i.e. nursery, immature and mature trees). Occurrence of this disease causes repeated post wintering defoliation that adversely affect the tree, resulting in reduced production and yield loss can be of more than 45 per cent. \n\nIn order to keep the sustainability of quality rubber production, there is a need to have an efficient disease management strategy in modern rubber growing. Despite the economic effect of CLF disease-causing pathogen on commercially grown rubber in the Philippines, screening for susceptibility among clones as a method to improve the management of this disease have not been examined. Thus, this study aims to identify and evaluate potential susceptible and resistant clones and specie to Corynespora Leaf Fall disease from introduced Hevea clones and specie by inducing CLFD-pathogen to the leaves of seedlings of different rubber clones in nursery to determine whether clonal variation could be used to better manage the disease problem.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000207","spatial":"Region

- Mapping Incidence and Distribution of Major Pests and  Diseases of Rubber in the Zamboanga Peninsula","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["4","5","7","8"],"description":"The rubber tree is subject to a plethora of economically important pathological problems, mainly of fungal origin, the Basidiomycetes. Pests and diseases of rubber could prevent and reduce the full yield potential in the rubber industry. \n\nLimited information can be found regarding the distribution of termite pest and fungal diseases of rubber in the Philippines. Knowledge on the spatial distribution of these diseases in and among rubber plantations and on consequences related to disease infection or disorder and eventual latex yield loss is important to consider in formulating effective integrated disease management strategies. This is also critical in sustaining the rubber industry especially in rehabilitating senile rubber plantations as planting materials can be severely infected to fungal diseases present in the field or from the neighboring rubber plantations. GIS maps are one of the tools in forecasting disease outbreaks and estimating damage and consequently in designing cost-effective and location-specific pest and disease management strategies appropriate for different cropping systems in the Zamboanga Peninsula. Thus, this study will potentially support the lack of technical knowledge of rubber farmers on rubber production and management especially on the control of pests and diseases in the region.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000208","spatial":"Region Specific","region":"9","states_id":["9"],"provinces_id":["78","79","80"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"2","rd":"1","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"2","iccable":"1","updates":"1.

Peninsula","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["4","5","7","8"],"description":"Rubber industry is an economically important industry in Western Mindanao, Philippines. The significant plantations in the Philippines are located in Zamboanga Peninsula. On the other hand, wastewater treatment is becoming more critical because of the diminishing water resources, increasing cost of wastewater disposal, and firmer regulations in connection to the contaminant levels in waste streams. \n\nAdsorption technique is an efficient process for the treatment of wastewater from various industrial plants. But this technique highly relies on the used adsorbent. The low-cost adsorbent should be easily available, abundant in nature, or a waste product from industrial and agricultural sectors. Agricultural products such as carabao manure, coconut shell, rice hull and saw dust due to its chemical composition such as holocellulose, lignin, and ash. Precursor materials can be activated using chemical agents (oxidizing agents) that will be utilized in wastewater treatment of natural rubber processing plants. \n\nThis project aims to produce and utilize activated carbon from carabao manure for the treatment of water effluent from natural rubber processing plant\t.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000209","spatial":"Region Specific","region":"9","states_id":["9"],"provinces_id":["80"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"2","rd":"1","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"2","iccable":"1","updates":"The project was approved during PRRI Collegial review last August 23, 2019.

expansion of rubber plantation in the country were lack of supply of quality planting materials, and low price of rubber products. One of the function of Philippine Rubber Research Institute (PRRI)  is to propagate and promote quality rubber planting materials, enable rubber industry stakeholders particularly smallholder rubber farmers to have access to quality rubber trees seedlings and showcase modern production techniques and other support services. With this project, it aims to comprehensively realize the goals of human empowerment and economic development in the countryside through programs and projects that will increase rubber production in the country and improve the quality of life especially in poor rural communities that depend primarily in this industry and to increase the available quality planting materials that are needed in the expansion of rubber areas.\t\n\nSpecifically, the project aims to: \n\n(1) To increase production of rubber through distribution of quality planting materials that are needed for the expansion of rubber areas; and\n(2) To establish and maintain PRRI Rubber Nursery in support to the distribution of quality planting materials to rubber farmer associations and cooperatives.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000210","spatial":"Interregional","region":"14","states_id":["41","7","8","9","10","11","12","14"],"provinces_id":["9","16","29","48","52","58","69","70","78","80"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"1","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"2","iccable":"1","updates":"(1)

Information needed in the implementation of these programs is dispersed to all provincial and regional offices. Obtaining such information from one office to another may cause some difficulty and a possible duplication of efforts in maintaining similar systems and\/or databases across different field offices occurs due to the geographical concerns. Obviously, there is a need to integrate information sources and build-up an agency-wide knowledge databank and up-to-date web portal to ensure easy access to updated, relevant and timely information. Improvement of electronic links within the organization as well as with the other external entities is also necessary. \n\nData and information systems on the geographical location of programs and projects of the agency presented in electronic maps are also needed to be developed for effective monitoring and to reduce the need for clients to physically go to PhilFIDA offices to avail of services or obtain the information they need. An improved internal system can be better delivered through the use of latest technologies on intranet and extranet solutions, particularly through web-enabled applications.\n\nVoice and data communication technologies can manage coordinative works between central office and different provincial and regional offices. Centralized system within the agency will further enhance productivity through web-enabled applications.\n\nThe ISSP aims to guide PhilFIDA in the implementation of its ICT initiatives and projects to enhance its performance and achieve its goals.
