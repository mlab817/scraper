[{"id":"32845","title":"AMAS - Improvement of the Value Chain of Selected Vegetables in Selected Areas in the Philippines","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["4"],"description":"The project aims to increase market efficiency and reduce post-harvest losses in the vegetable industry through the improvement of marketing practices and the introduction of new technologies\/systems. We would like to improve the processes along the value chain to get better prices for farmers' produce.In the long-run, we would like our farmers to be able to effectively engage in entrepreneurship in order to be able to sell directly to consumers\/buyers thereby reducing the multi-layered marketing system for vegetables.\t\n\nSpecifically, this aims to improve the farming practices, post-harvest and marketing system with new and appropriate technologies to provide better value of farmers' products; to capacitate AMAS, AMAD, LGUs, and farmers with new farming, value-adding, and marketing technologies.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000299","spatial":"Interregional","region":"40","states_id":["15","2","40"],"provinces_id":["13","55","61"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"1","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"2","iccable":"1","updates":"With concept note","asof":"2019-10-28","mainpdp":"8","otherpdp":[],"na_rm":"1","output":"(1) Developed and enhanced Vegetable value Chain Roadmap;
