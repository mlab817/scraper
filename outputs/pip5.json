An inclusive and globally competitive rubber industry providing sustainable benefits to all stakeholders is envisioned for the Philippine rubber industry, with the goal of increasing the benefits of all the stakeholders, thereby spreading the gains down to the smallholders in the remote barangays in all rubber producing provinces in the regions. For the past year, low production of rubber yield emerges as a major constraint in the rubber industry which is mainly attributed in low pricing, in addition the improper fertilization management\/nutrient management, emergence of pests and diseases, uses of unsuited rubber clones for plantation, lack of information on rubber clone agronomic characteristics and natural calamities. The development of technologies to support decision-making in production, pricing, good agricultural practices, market, pest and diseases management. The derived information will be useful for the farmers, planners, and researchers. Philippines Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) needs timely accurate statistics on natural rubber regularly to monitor and to take suitable measures in the interest of the Philippines rubber sector.\t\n\nGenerally, this study will enable the Philippine Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) to map the areas vulnerable to soil erosion, estimating the area for further cultivation, and clone suitability map through GIS and Remote Sensing technologies. Furthermore this study will assess the spatial distribution of rubber area over different classes of elevation and slope and the traditional rubber clone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preference, it will help to fully understand the dynamics of rubber plantation activity in the rubber traditional regions of the Philippines and understanding the variation in the productivity of rubber ecosystem in the Philippines.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000249","spatial":"Interregional","region":"14","states_id":["9","10","11","12","13","14"],"provinces_id":["2","3","9","16","21","26","27","28","29","30","41","42","44","48","49","66","69","71","72","73","74","76","78","79","80","81","82","83","88"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"1","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":["5"],"subsectors":[],"status":["9"],"risk":"Implementation Risks: Slow to non - participation of the rubber farmer to thier responsibilities of the project.

- Farm Mechanization","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["4","7"],"description":"Dairy farming today requires the use of farm machineries and equipment which are considered valuable inputs particularly in forage production and pasture development.  While such equipment offers a wide range of benefits in terms of developing and increasing production of forage for dairy animals, not all dairy farmers have the capacity to purchase their own equipment taking into account the financial obligations that they need to fulfil in managing their respective farms.\n\nAs the agency mandated to accelerate the development of the local dairy industry, the NDA is committed to providing the local dairy farmers the access to various dairy equipment and facilities that can be of great help in improving their dairy farm operations. It is in this light, that the NDA would like to propose the provision of one (1) agricultural tractor, one (1) forage chopper, one (1) truck, and one (1) warehouse to each of the six (6) Regional Departments of the NDA namely, Northern Luzon, Southern Luzon, Central Visayas, Western Visayas, Northern Mindanao and Southern Mindanao. \n\nThe NDA shall be the executing agency of the project whose major tasks include: formulating rules and guidelines as regards to the use of the tractor and forage chopper; deployment of the equipment to the requesting farmers\/farmers' groups; overall maintenance of the equipment; and conduct of regular monitoring of the project. \n\nThe NDA uses this proposed project as the vehicle to support local dairy farmers in their goal of further enhancing dairy farm operations to achieve better milk yield and ensuring the availability of feeds for dairy animals. In addition, the agency seeks to develop more contract growers to serve as feeds source of the local dairy farmers and contract growers for specialized skills in calf rearing and grow-out farming. \n\nThe tractors, trucks, and forage choppers would be provided on hire basis to the local dairy farmers through the NDA Regional Department assisting them. Each department shall be responsible in ensuring the equity in the distribution of assistance to the farmers.\n\nThe project will enhance farm operations and increase forage production of local dairy farmers. It also aims to develop more contract growers as feeds source.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000254","spatial":"Interregional","region":"11","states_id":["3","40","7","10","11"],"provinces_id":["12","17","25","29","81"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"1","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"2","iccable":"1","updates":"No project fund as of September 2019.

Through these herd build-up strategies, the existing underutilized government stock farms will be able to house more dairy animals. Also, more stock farms will be established to accommodate more dairy animals. Latest technology in animal breeding and milk collection will be made available in these farms\/centers. \n\nThe project moves along the programs of rural industrialization and industry dispersal as provided for in Republic Act 8435, also known as the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA). The establishment of milk processing centers and engagement in dairy farming will give opportunities for employment to residents in rural areas near the centers and farms and will reduce propensity to migrate to urban areas.\n\nThe project aims to contribute in the dairy industry development in the country, specifically:\n  - Contribute 95% of the national milk target (or 40% of the milk deficiency3) through sustainable production and processing of 125 tons of local milk daily by increasing the number of dairy animals by at least one (1) boatload (1,200 head) every year through importation and upgrade of local dairy cattle;\n  - To create livelihood and employment opportunities in accordance to the rural industrialization and dispersal programs provided for in the AFMA.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000258","spatial":"Interregional","region":"11","states_id":["40","5","6","7","10","11"],"provinces_id":["40"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"1","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":["6"],"subsectors":["19"],"status":["3"],"risk":"To be determined once the project document is finalized","ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"2","iccable":"1","updates":"Pre-feasibilty was done by DAP through PDS.

processing and utilization to address issues and concerns related to fiber production, quality and utilization of natural fibers such as abaca, banana, pineapple, sisal and other minor fibers. Specifically, the sub-program component undertakes the following;1.1 Design\/development\/improvement of  machines\/tools\/devices;  1.2.  Identification of new uses for natural fibers to promote their utilization development and identification of new uses for natural fibers to promote their utilization in line with environment  conciousness for green economy and utilization of renewable resources; 1.3  Raw material manipulation of fibers to create a variety of different effects using fibers, fabrics and other materials for the different fiber properties 1.4 Disseminate developed  technologies as technology source for community -based livelihood project in coordination with ESETS. The Fiber Utilization and Technology Division (FUTD) personnel who developed the technologies acted as Resource Speaker in disseminating  the techniques, cost and return analysis and sustainability approaches for each recipient association\/organization\/cooperative to develop them into a   business enterprise as source of livelihood.\n1.4  Laboratory services on fiber identification, analysis of morphological, physical and chemical properties of fibers are undertaken to cater to the needs of the industry stakeholders such as the farmers, cordage makers, pulp processors and trade exporters of raw fibers. The Fiber Processing and Utilization Laboratory (FPUL) provides state-of-the-art capabilities for the testing and study of natural fibers emphasizing the characteristics to achieve desired fiber properties and functions.  It is a science-based user facility simultaneously developing strong scientific programs while offering broad access to its capabilities and collaboration. The FPUL can assist the businesses in complying with the requests needed.  The sectors that would most likely support the upgrading of the FPUL are the farmers, fiber processors, academe, private businessmen and LGUs. In all cases, the local government units always request FPUL for technical assistance in terms of value-adding activities and income generation\/employment opportunities.  These activities can easily be adapted by their constituents because of the following reasons: a.  Doable and can be considered as a backyard industry b.  Developed products \n\n1. Developed machines\/tools \/devices ; 2. Generated technologies on fiber proccessing and utilization that can be disseminated to industry sector and communities in coordination with LGUs to improve livelihood","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2021-05001-000288","spatial":"Region Specific","region":"16","states_id":["16"],"provinces_id":["85"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"1","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"1","iccable":"1","updates":"1.
