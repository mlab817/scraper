Delays in project implementation - Proper and on-time monitoring of projects\n4. New government policies - Train employees to be more responsive to change\n5. Change of Administration - Train employees to be more responsive to change\n6. Politics - Prepare and protect employees in dealing with this risk while ensuring that the dairy value chain is not disrupted in the event of the risk happening\n7. Peace and Order - Pre-identifying areas vulnerable to peace and order issues and prepare risk mitigation strategies for said areas","ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":199945000.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":520213000.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":271441300.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":266492000.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":312103000.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":338087000.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"1","iccable":"1","updates":"Outcome Indicators\n1.

overfishing. The project will add to the transformation of the seafood market by mainstreaming sustainability in the value chain of important commodities platforms, and fisheries improvement projects (FIP), developing national capacities, and generating learning to be shared worldwide. The project will allocate GEF resources strategically to 1) engage major seafood buyers in the main world markets (EU, Japan, US) into responsible sourcing, providing tools to prepare and implement sustainable seafood sourcing policies, 2) adapt the concept of green commodities platforms in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia and Philippines to generate experience that could be used in other countries, 3) support stakeholders of these platforms to develop practical experience with fisheries improvement projects and upgrade existing tools for FIP implementation and monitoring, and 4) upgrade existing information platforms to facilitate access to reliable materials to value chain stakeholders in support of sound decision making, and capturing documenting and disseminating the learnings of the project. The project target fisheries include tuna fisheries in the Pacific Ocean, Mahi-mahi and large pelagic fish in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, Indonesian snapper, Octopus and blue swimming crab fisheries in Philippines.\nThe project is an inter-regional intervention. Market engagement and knowledge management are global components. The sustainable marine commodities platforms and FIPs will be implemented, using a participatory approach in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia and Philippines.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2020-05001-000120","spatial":"Nationwide","region":"13","states_id":["5","6","7","8","9","13"],"provinces_id":[],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"2","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"1","iccable":"1","updates":"This

Infrastructure\n\n1. Establishment of Dairy Marketing Centers \na. These marketing centers, equipped with chillers, shall be established within existing NDA-assisted dairy zones or dairy areas. It must be situated in strategic areas or commercial centers where local consumers can easily access the products. \nb. Dairy farmers can go to these dairy marketing centers to sell their products. Since smallhold dairy farmers will undergo capability training on home based processing, they will be able to process their own products, sell through these marketing centers and earn more income.  \nc.  The NDA will initially oversee the center under its Business Development Unit and eventually tap the NDA trained personnel of the Federation or dairy cooperatives to manage or run the centers. The dairy cooperatives\/federations\/private entities shall pay corresponding commissioned-based fees to NDA for every product sold in the center. The fees collected will go back to the marketing centers to cover the maintenance costs.\nd. NDA will continuously monitor the marketing centers.\n\n2. Establishment of Dairy Post-harvest facilities \na. Post-harvest facilities such as milk collection centers with cold storage equipment shall be established to ensure the quality of milk collected for processing plants. \nb. Farmers can go to these collection centers and sell their raw milk produce and the collection center will bring the milk to the milk processing plant.\nc. The NDA will establish these milk collection centers and shall be leased (Lease to own scheme) to cooperatives or federations.\nd. Through a partnership forged between the federation or cooperatives and the marketing center thru NDA, products from the milk processing plants will be supplied to the marketing centers.\n\nB. Capacity Building\n\nAs the country recognizes the need to develop its dairy industry, priority programs such as training programs for dairy farmers and cooperatives shall be enhanced. Dairy sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competiveness and capacities will be fully strengthened in the country as extension services will continue to magnify its horizons by providing adequate and timely training and education. The following trainings will be conducted:\na. Homebased Milk Processing\nb. Milk Quality Assurance\nc. Business Management (Accounting & Bookkeeping)\nd. Milk Marketing\ne. Trainings on other business opportunities (meat processing (for male calves), vermi-culture, biogas, forage production)\n\nThis project aims to enhance existing dairy-based livelihood particularly on milk collection, processing and marketing to make dairying a sustainable source of income for dairy farmers. It intends to promote the marketability of locally produced milk and milk products.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2020-05001-000135","spatial":"Interregional","region":"11","states_id":["16","3","40","7","10","11"],"provinces_id":["85"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"1","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":["6"],"subsectors":["18"],"status":["3"],"risk":"As of date no funding source","ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"2","iccable":"1","updates":"Have yet to identify funding source","asof":"2018-10-25","mainpdp":"8","otherpdp":["9"],"na_rm":"","output":"1.

- Dairy Goat Farming: A Livelihood Opportunity for Rural Farm families","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["7"],"description":"The proposed program will revolve around a community dairy goat farming concept. In this concept, communities will be identified where dairy goat farms will be established and will function as a goat multiplier farm, dairy production area, and learning site. In this arrangement, farmers will raise the animals given to them by the program in a common area with complete facilities and provision of necessary implements. They will be assisted too in the marketing through the program initiatives.\n\nThe implementation of the program will be by module, wherein one beneficiary community will receive one. A module of this program will have the following components: 100 breeder does and 5 breeder bucks; 1 goat house; Developed pasture; Milking and milk processing and storage equipment; Farm implements; Barn and storage; Starting feeds, drugs, and biologics; and Training of recipients.\n\nThe beneficiaries shall provide an agricultural land area (minimum of 4 hectares) for the project as a counterpart. The daily operations and accompanying costs of operation will be shouldered by the beneficiaries. The farmer beneficiaries and their families will operate the farm, each owning 10 heads of does. The milk produced will be processed in the farm and will be marketed as a whole. Income will then be divided among the beneficiaries depending on the volume of their production on a day-to-day basis.\n\nIn the aspect of marketing, the program had included the milk-feeding strategy to ensure a ready market for the milk produced by the farms. The milk-feeding concept will be an outfit that will buy the milks produced and processed by the modules and bring it for milk-feeding programs for malnourished children in the locality. With this set-up, the program will not only resolve the market obstacle, but will help address malnutrition among children.\n\nThis is designed to safeguard the project and the animals from threats like non-compliance of beneficiaries, lack of resources, and poor monitoring and to ensure that the targets are achieved and the recipients will experience the impact of the program in their lives.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2020-05001-000142","spatial":"Interregional","region":"14","states_id":["15","1","2","3","40","41","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14"],"provinces_id":["17"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"1","rd":"0","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":["6"],"subsectors":["18"],"status":["3"],"risk":"Implementation Risk as follows:\n1.

Comparative Impact Study of Dairy Farming vs. Pure Crop Farming as Poverty Reduction Strategy","prog_proj":"2","reg_prog":"0","bases":["4","7"],"description":"Dairy Farming has always been construed to be a prohibitive and labor-intensive farming activity unlike crop farming.  Government investments have always been hugely spent for rice and high value crops while dairy programs were minimally funded in comparison.  \n\nStatistics show that despite the lack of investments, the growth of the dairy sector has been at an average of 6.3% (2010-2015).  Small hold dairy farmers have considered dairy farming as their livelihood that can provide for their families needs.  The most compelling reason why dairy farmers continue to pursue dairying as a living is profit.\n\nThe government, the private sector and future dairy players need to be convinced that dairy farming and all of its related activities are profitable, hence, need investments.  The local dairy industry needs to be promoted as one of the agricultural commodity poverty reduction driver particularly in the rural areas.  Studies shall be documented and backed up by scientific evidence to firm up the cause, hence, this study.","agency_id":"19","motheragency_id":"0","code":"2020-05001-000143","spatial":"Interregional","region":"14","states_id":["15","1","2","3","40","41","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14"],"provinces_id":["12","15","17","18","37","40","49","54"],"pip":"1","pip_typo":"2","rd":"1","cip":"1","cip_typo":"","trip":"1","rdip":"1","rdc_endorsement":"0","rdc_endorsed_notendorsed":"0","rdc_date_endorsement":"","sectors":[],"subsectors":[],"status":[],"risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"implementationreadiness":"2","iccable":"1","updates":"Project proposal submitted to FAO for possible funding","asof":"2019-10-18","mainpdp":"8","otherpdp":[],"na_rm":"","output":"1.
